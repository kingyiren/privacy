INFO
All our Apps does not share any personal information with third parties and us(JimTeam).
By default, our products use no permissions as much as possible. If some permissions are used, it only means that they are necessary for the current function.
Even if you want，you can turn off the app's Internet permissions, then all the features will still work fine.
Unless the product function requires the use of the Internet, in addition to paying to subscribe to our server resources, you can also use your own server and deploy our free software on the server. In this case, in addition to the cost of purchasing the software, the service fee is free .
